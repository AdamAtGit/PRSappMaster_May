//TODO: ARS- Change repos from and too as shown below
Currently using PRSappEFCoreSqlite, but has prob.
	   Opening repositories:
C:\Users\Flazz\source\repos\FebOn\0_PRSapp_Master_Wip\PRSapp


This is what you need to paste in team explorer window for new remote repo(sync):
https://github.com/AdamAtGit/Repo_Master_Wip.git



RECOVERY STEPS:

Best for now to just go to each file's history and copy and paste

***Revert- is the whole Repo (ie solution and projects)
